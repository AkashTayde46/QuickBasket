redux: redux is like a store which stores all required information and any componenet can access the information from that store

// How JWT Works in Authentication
Login:

A user logs in by providing their credentials (e.g., email and password).
The server verifies the credentials and generates a JWT with user-related data (e.g., id, role).
Token Transmission:

The server sends the token to the client (usually stored in a cookie or localStorage).
Subsequent Requests:

The client includes the JWT in the Authorization header (e.g., Bearer <token>).
The server verifies the token using the secret key, ensuring it hasn't been tampered with.
If valid, the server allows access to protected resources.
